# veGAN
Our very exceptional generative adversarial network 

To run:

`
$ python run.py
`

Inside of run.py, you can specify a multitude of parameters. Whether to load at a given epoch, which optimization algorithm to
use for generator/discriminator, and batch size.


The network architectures are in the model folder, and there are a variety of utilities, such as minibatch discrimination, in the utils folder.
